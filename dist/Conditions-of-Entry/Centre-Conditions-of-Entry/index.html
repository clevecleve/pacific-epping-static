      <li>By entering the Centre, each person consents to their information (including images) being recorded by such surveillance equipment and to the Owner disclosing the information recorded to anyone (including law enforcement bodies and persons involved in relevant legal or disciplinary actions) to the extent that the Owner deems such disclosure to be necessary to protect its lawful interests, the public interest or the safety or persons or property at the Centre.</li>
      <li>The Owner may collect personal information about any person entering the Centre in order to operate the Centre, to manage operations at the Centre, to provide people with services, features and functions related to their use of the Centre, and for purposes set out in the Owner's Privacy Policy.

Persons are encouraged to contact the information desk in the Centre for information on the Owner's Privacy Policy or view it here (<a href="/privacy-policy">https://www.qicre.com/privacy-policy</a>). The Privacy Policy contains information relating to access and correction of personal information, about how any persons may complain about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles and how the Owner will deal with such a complaint.

      <li>To the full extent permitted by law, the Owner is not liable for any loss, damage or injury to any property or person in the Centre and all persons agree to release the Owner from any and all claims in relation to such matters, other than to the extent such loss, damage or injury to any property or person in the Centre is caused by the negligent act or omission of the Owner, its managers, employees, servants and agents.</li>
      <li>To the full extent permitted by law, each person releases the Owner from all actions and demands due to any loss, death, damage or injury occurring in the Centre other than to the extent such loss, death, damage or injury is caused by the negligent act or omission of the Owner, its managers, employees, servants and agents.
